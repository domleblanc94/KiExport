# Mitayi Pico R0.6

**Mitayi Pico** is the first development board from **CIRCUITSTATE Electronics**. It is a small development board based on the **RP2040** microcontroller from Raspberry Pi. The board is designed after the official Pico board from Raspberry Pi, but adds a few improvements over it.

The schematic and PCB are designed with **KiCad**, an open-source EDA tool. All the design files of Mitayi Pico are completely open-source and released under the MIT license.

## Features & Differences

* RP2040 dual-core, 133MHz ARM Cortex M0+ microcontroller.
* Up to 16MB Flash memory in SOIC-8 package.
* Dual USB port options; Type-C and Micro-USB.
* Linear Low-drop voltage regulator MIC5219.
* Reset button.
* BOOTSEL button.
* Solder jumper on debug LED.
* Breaks out all GPIO pins.
* EXP8 expansion connector in 2x4 2.54mm pin header. Breaks out SPI, UART and I2C.
* Uses 0402 or larger SMD packages.
* **Mitayi-Pico is not pin-compatible with the official Raspberry Pi Pico.**
* Same dimensions of 21 mm x 50 mm, with almost the same positions for mounting holes.
* Completely open-source design made with KiCad 7.
